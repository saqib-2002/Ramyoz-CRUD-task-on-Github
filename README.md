# Next.js & TypeScript Assignment

## Overview
This project was completed as part of an internship evaluation task using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.

---

## Work Timeline
The task was assigned during the interview, after which I left the office around **3:30 PM** and reached home by **4:30 PM**.  
I started working on the task around **8:00 PM** and completed the implementation within **20–25 minutes**.

During setup, I faced an issue installing a Next.js app in my local VS Code environment, which I resolved. The code was initially developed in **GitHub Codespaces** and then transferred to my local machine after fixing the issue.
